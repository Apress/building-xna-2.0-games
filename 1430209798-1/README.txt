Building XNA 2.0 Games

Downloadable code readme
---------------

All downloadable solutions are zipped; to use them simply download, extract, and open in Microsoft Visual C# 2005 Express Edition.

We highly recommend just downloading the FINAL source to use while following the book—this will help you get a good feel for where we’re going in building Zombie Smashers.

For XNAPong, download CH02.

We’ve grouped content from earlier chapters into separate code drops—if you need help reading it and don’t want to run across content that is addressed in later chapters, download CH05, CH06, CH10 and CH11.

To install everything you need to load and deploy the projects, download and install XNA Game Studio 2.0 from http://creators.xna.com/ . 
 
For a quick start, the XNA team put together this page: http://creators.xna.com/en-US/create_detail .


Thanks and good luck!
